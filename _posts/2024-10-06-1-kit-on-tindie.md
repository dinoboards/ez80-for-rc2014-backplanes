The **eZ80 for RC** kit is now available from my Tindie store.

A super easy kit to build with everything needed to explore the most advanced Z80 based CPU available.

I have also started to build up a new website detailing all my kits: [www.dinoboards.com.au](https://www.dinoboards.com.au/)

It includes a page for the new **eZ80 for RC** kit:  [www.dinoboards.com.au/ez80-for-rc](https://www.dinoboards.com.au/ez80-for-rc)

The plan is to consolidate all supporting materials for all kits and projects on this new site.

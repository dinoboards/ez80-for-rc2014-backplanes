I am very excited to announce that Wayne Warthen has accepted my pull requests for the eZ80 module into his mega [RomWBW](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) project. The eZ80 support is now part of the mainline code base.  Still very much under development and early alpha - but official!

I am very thankful to Wayne for his assistance in the development of the eZ80 for RC2014/RCBus.

> Wayne has also received a kit and will soon be able to personally validate the eZ80 operation.

And in other news, I started experimenting with a Pi Pico this weekend to see if I could make a programmer for the eZ80 (as a possible replacement for the very expensive Zilog programmer). I thought to myself, surely this cant be too hard to do.  When will I learn not to call myself Shirley!

title: eZ80 Module
---

<p>This is the heart of the design.&nbsp; A simple breakout PCB to map the various pins of the eZ80&nbsp;to a standard 2.54mm (100mil) pin.&nbsp; Its a 4 layer PCB, (4 layer boards are very cheap these days).&nbsp; The 2 inner layers solid ground planes, which should help with cross talk and other noise issues.</p>

<p>In addition to the eZ80&nbsp;chip on the PCB, there are:</p>

<ul><li>A few SMD decoupling capacitors around the chip, to help give it a nice stable 3.3V power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A ZDI 6 pin interface.&nbsp; This is the Zilog propriety interface to flash and control the chip.&nbsp; Using the<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Zilog Smart Cable adapter</em>, I can update the flash and also do step-by-step debugging of real code on the chip.&nbsp;</li><li>A 32.768kHz crystal and a couple of capacitors for the on-chip Real-Time-Clock circuit</li></ul>

<p>There has been a few iterations of this module.<br></p>

<p>The first one, I had goofed, and on one of the power lines, accidentally swapped the VDD and VSS signals - basically shorting out the power!<br></p>

<p>The 2nd iteration worked well.&nbsp; It included an onboard SMD oscillator (18.432Mhz) for the main clock.&nbsp; I tested using the Zilog Smart Cable adapter.&nbsp; And was able to load code on to the flash, then run it with the debugger, stepping through the instructions.&nbsp; Wrote some code to toggle some of the GPIO pins and confirmed that they did indeed -- toggle!&nbsp; That was a cool moment of success!</p>

<p>Despite my wobbly hands and poor eyesight, this was all hand assembled successfully using my soldering iron, and a magnifier.&nbsp; Was very excited when it all seemed to be working as intended.&nbsp; <em>(Somehow I avoided bridges across the pins of the eZ80)</em></p>

<p>For the 3rd iteration, as shown below, I removed the on-board oscillator. With the intention that the mounting PCB will provide a TTL 5V clock.&nbsp; This means I can use a standard DIP8 oscillator (have lots of those and much easier to solder).</p>

<p>I also changed the pin mounting.&nbsp; Before I was using standard 2.54mm PCB connectors. The same kind of connectors used on the backplane.&nbsp; It worked - but for this iteration, I changed to use PCB pins.&nbsp; They are a bit smaller -- with so many pins, it will be much easier to insert and remove the module from the socket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below is a render of the a 4th design, that's yet to be made.&nbsp; It has just a few minor tweaks.&nbsp; A fix for the LED (silkscreen has the led orientation wrong) and some other minor adjustments.</p>
